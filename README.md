## Content

Each folder in the repository contains the respective course material, including codes and summaries. 

The codes are stored in the `source-code` folder within each course folder, and the summaries are stored in the `README.md` files of each course folder. The summaries are a way of recording the main lessons learned in each course and serve as a quick reference for future consultations.
